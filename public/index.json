The first post focused mainly on particpants and performance. In this post we will look at pacing. How do runners pace the Boston Marathon? Are there significant pacing differences associated with gender and age? Does ability or finish-time influence pacing? How does hitting the wall impact pacing? We will attempt to shed light on these questions using a dataset of more than 70,000 finishing-times for the Boston Marathon.   Introduction This is the second in a series of posts on a data analysis of the Boston Marathon. The first post focused on particpants and performance. In this post we will look at pacing. How do typical runners pace the hilly Boston course? Are there differences between men and women? How does age influence pacing? Do faster elite runners pace their race differently to slower recreational runners? These are just some of the questions that we will endeavour to answer, or let the data answer.\nThe dataset contains Boston Marathon finishing times for over 75,000 participants across 2015, 2016, \u0026amp; 2017; a small fraction of records have been excluded (\u0026lt;1%) because of missing timing data or other anomalies. Each remaining race-record includes information such as the gender and age of the runner, their country, state, and/or city of origin, their overall finish-time, and their split-times for 5km intervals along the course.\n Segment Paces To begin, let’s look at the how runners pace the various segments of the race. Since dataset includes timing information for each runner at 5km intervals (approx. every 3.1 miles), which means we can calculate how pacing changes across 9 different segments of the race (5km, 10km, . . ., 35km, 40km, 42.2km).\nThe graph below shows the pace (minutes per mile), for each of the 9 race segments, averaged over all runners (male and female) in our dataset; we refer to this as a pacing profile because it shows how pacing changes across the course. We see how, on average, men start out faster than 8 mins/mile and gradually slow, eventually hitting about 10 mins/mile at the end of the race, before a final sprint to the finish. The profile for women is similar in shape but obviously reflects different actual paces.\nClearly the average runner slows considerably during the course of the marathon. This is not unusual, especially in Boston, as fatigue and hills take their toll during the second-half of the race. Note,the pacing of the later stages of the race will also be impacted by those runners who hit the wall (HTW); we will return to this presently. Figure 1 also shows the average pacing profile of the top 100 fastest men and women. Obviously these runners are running a much faster race (\u0026lt; 5:30 mins/mile for men and \u0026lt; 6:30 mins/mile for women), but it is also a much more evenly paced race, at least when compared to the average runner.\n The Small Matter of Hitting the Wall In this work we determine that someone hits the wall if their pace in any of the second-half segments of the race slows by at least 33%, relative to their pace during the first-half of the race, but excluding the first 5km segment. We exclude the first 5km segment because it tends to be associated with fairly erratic pacing, due to the excitement of the start of the race, and, as such, provides a poor baseline against which to judge a runner’s marathon pace. Based on this model of hitting the wall, just over 23% of Boston runners hit the wall —they slow by at least 33% for at least one 5km segment during the second half of the race — with men experiencing a much higher rate of hitting the wall (10%) compared with women (4%).\nWe will return to the issue of hitting the wall in a lot more detail in a future post, for now it is sufficient to know that we have a way to estimate those who hit the wall and, as such, we can separate-out these runners from the pacing profiles to get a clearer picture of how the average runner paces their race, in the absence of a catestrophic pacing event, such as hitting the wall.\n## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39; The pacing profiles in Figure 2 do just this: separating runners who hit the wall (HTW) from those who do not. We can see a much more even pacing profile for those who avoid the wall compared to those who hit it. For example, the average male who hits the wall sees their pace slowing to almost 12 mins/mile in the latter stages of the race, compared with just 9 mins/mile for those who do not appear to hit the wall. A similar relative difference in pacing is evident for women, although, it is worth remembering that almost 3-times as many men hit the wall than women.\n Relative Pacing Profiles So far we have looked at pacing profiles based on actual pacing values, measured in minutes per mile. Another approach is to focus on a relative pacing profile by calculating how each segment’s pace varies from the runner’s average race pace. For example if a runner’s average race pace (calculated over the duration of their race) is 10 mins/mile and they run the first 5km at 9 mins/mile then their relative or percentage pace for this first segment is 90%, since they run at 90% of their average race pace (that is, 10% faster than their average race pace).\nThe average percentage pacing profiles are shown below in Figure 3 for three groups of (male and female) runners: (1) all runners who do not hit the wall; (2) all runners who do hit the wall (HTW); (3) the top 100 fastest runners (Elite). Remember, paces are now percentage paces rather than actual mins/mile and so they are directly coparable across runner groups.\n## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39; The most important thing to note is the shape of the pacing profile for those runners who hit the wall, compared to those who do not. The former, start their race, on average, about 15% faster than their (eventual) average race pace. Do remember this average race pace will be impacted by hitting the wall, likely exagerting the pace variations of faster early segments.\nRegardless, it is clear that starting fast is associated with hitting the wall, as has been previously reported. These runners also slow dramatically in the second-half of the race, slow their pace by more than 20% compared to their average race pace; men slow more than women, relatively speaking.\nBy comparison, those who do not hit the wall, and the fastest runners in particular, run a much more controlled and evenly paced race. They start a little faster than average race pace, but not too much faster, and they finish a little slower than average race pace, but not too much slower. The average runner maintains a pacing profile that is within +/- 8% of their average race pace; for the fastest elites pacing remains within +/- 4–5% of average race pace.\n Pacing Varation Generally speaking, less pace variation is considered to be a sign of a more disciplined runner, and it is usually associated with a better race. Hitting the wall is one example of what happens when pacing goes very wrong, but obviously there is a contiuum of pace variation across the marathon field. One perspective on this is presented in Figure 3, which plots the percentage pace variation versus finish-time to better understand the relationship between pacing and ability. The precise measure of pace variation that we use is something called the coefficient of variation, which is calculated from the 9 segment paces for each runner. Suffice it to say that a high percentage pace variation means that the runner is changing their pace more that a runner with a low pace variation. In other words, the higher the pace variation the more erratic the pacing.\n## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; ## Warning: Removed 2496 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth). Generally speaking we can see that pace variation tends to increase steadily with finish-times, suggesting that faster, more able, runners are better able to control their pace. As expected, the fastest runners have very low pace variation values and in general women present with less pace variation than men for a given finish-time, a distinction that is greater when we look at runners who hit the wall.\nThis gender difference in pacing is an important one. In the literature it has been reported that women enjoy more disciplined pacing profiles than men, and while this appears to be the case this year in Boston, it is also true that much of the pacing variation between the genders appears to originate with those who hit the wall. Men who hit the wall tend experience a higher degree of pacing variation (and a larger slow-down) than women and many more men tend to hit the wall, thereby exagerating the pacing difference between the genders when we combine all runners into a single group. By separating those who hit the wall from those who don’t, we can see a more similar pacing regime between the genders when they avoid the wall.\n Pacing \u0026amp; Ageing Finally, let’s consider the relationship between pace variation and age. The graph below shows the average pace variation for men and women across different ages. Once again we separate out those who hit the wall from those who do not. The pace variation for the latter is all but identical for men and women across the ages. For younger runners in their 20’s pace variation tends to gradually decline into our 30s, before growing again steadily if we continue to race into our 60s and 70s. For those who hit the wall there is a similar effect although younger (55) women tend to suffer from less pace variation when they hit the wall than their male counterparts.\n Conclusions In this post we have analysed the from the Boston Matathon between 2015 \u0026amp; 2017 with a view to better understand the pacing pattersn of runners during the race\n The data suggest that many runners adopt a similar relative pacing profile, starting faster than their average race pace and finishing slower.\n Those who manage their pace effectively tend to pace within +/-8% of their average race pace. The best of the best do better, maintaining more even pacing within +/-5% of average race pace.\n In contrast, those who do not manage their pacing effectively — runners who hit the wall — suffer greatly as their pacing collapses during the second half of the race. The likelihood of hitting the wall is much higher for men.\n   ","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"78035612a719cd91deae65ecf080ebe8","permalink":"/post/boston_pacing/xxx_pacing_boston/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/boston_pacing/xxx_pacing_boston/","section":"post","summary":"SUMMARY ABOUT BOSTON","tags":["Academic","R Markdown","Visualization"],"title":"Pacing Boston","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Boston Marathon","R","Running"],"content":" A Data Analysis of the Boston Marathon TLDR  What happened at the Boston Marathon the past few years? In this article I present an initial analysis based on the data from this year’s event.\n For now we will focus on the participants of this year’s race — their gender, age, place of origin — comparing their participation numbers and finish-times.\n   Introduction With the Boston Marathon quickly approching I thought I would write up a few posts on the data generated by the thousands of runners who completed the punishing course during the years: 2015, 2016, 2017. The data was generously provided by Kaggle. Combined, the dataset contains Boston Marathon finishing times for over 75,000 participants. A small fraction of records have been excluded (\u0026lt;1%) because they contained missing timing data or other anomalies. Each observations includes information such as the gender and age of the runner, their country, state, and/or city of origin, their overall finish-time, and the split-times for 5km intervals along the course.\nThis will be the first of a sequence of posts over the next few weeks. In it I will focus on the runners of the Boston Marathon looking at factors such as gender, age, and place of origin and how they influence performance. Later posts will consider pacing, hitting the wall, Boston qualification times, among other topics, which are hopefull of interest to marathon runners and data-geeks alike.\n Look Who’s Runnning Let’s start by looking at the runners themselves, their gender, age, and places of origin.\nGender \u0026amp; Age The bar chart, Figure 1, below shows that overall about 45% of Boston runners are female and the line-graph shows that they have an average age of about 40, some 5 years younger than their male counterparts.\nThe nice thing about the Boston dataset is that it provides precise age information for each runner, as opposed to the age-ranges that are more usual in marathon datasets. Further detail on the distribution of ages is presented in the histograms in Figure 2, which show the relative proportion of runners of each gender and for different ages. For example, we can see a greater proportion of women between the ages of 20 and 42, compared to men. But, from 42 years on, there are proprtionally more men than women.\nIt is interesting to contrast sharp increase in the proportion of females runners from ages 20 to 28, compared to a more gradual increase for men between the ages of 20 and 45. In both cases, after the age of 45, the proportion of runners participating in Boston drops steadily.\n Places of Origin Where do these runners come from? Unsurprisingly, the large majority (over 60,000) come from the USA, and about a fifth of these from Boston’s home state of Massachusetts. Approximately 1,800 runners come from Canada and after that there is a long tail of countries with different levels of partcipation. All in all, these three years Boston attracted runners from 104 different countries around the world.\nLet’s take a look at some of these. First, for ease of presentation, we will limit ourselves to countries that have more than 50 runners participating; there are 23 such countries. To avoid the USA and Canada from drowning out the other countries we will exclude both of these from the graphs that follow. The first graph below shows the total number of participants per country for the remaining 21 countries. Great Britain comes out on top, with more than 400 runners, followed by Mexico, Germany, Japan, and Australia.\n What about the locals? Since we left out the USA from the above analysis, let’s now take a look at US participation by state and by city; once again, for ease of presentation we will limit ourselves to the top 20 states and cities and for variety, this time, we will show the number of male and female runners. In the first graph below — participation by state — we see a much higher participation level from Massachusetts along with a healthy showing from California, New York, and Texas. Similarly, Boston and Cambridge feature strongly in the next graph — participation by city — with the likes of New York and Chicago, two big marathon cities, also providing plenty of runners.\nIt may be worth noting that while most states and cities provide more men that women to run Boston, Boston itself, and Massachusetts, provide more female runners than males. I’ve added my hometown of Pico Rivera to soley represent.\n  Marathon Performance The Fastest Countries and States Again just for fun, let’s return to the country and states of origin of our Boston runners and try to determine those countries and states with the fastest runners; once again we will limit ourselves to the countries and states used above.\nTo keep things simple — but not too simple — we will consider two different ways to answer this question. The first way is to compute the average finish-time for all runners from a particular country or state. This is effectively the finish-time of the typical runner from that country or state, and may favour countries and states with fewer participants, as these participants may be more experienced marathoners.\nThe second way to evaluate how fast the runners from a given country or state are, is to focus on the fastest finishers — we will look at the top-10 finishers from each country and state — and report their average finish-times. The results of this for countries and states are presented in the two graphs that follow; in both the countries and states are ordered based on the average finish-times of their top-10 fastest runners.\nWhen we focus on the finish-time of all runners, Kenya and Ethopia come out on top of the country rankings, with average finish-times of 148 and 154 minutes, respectively; see Figure 8. This is better than most counties fastest-times averages. But when we look at the average finish-time of the fastest (top-10) runners then the US, Japan, and Canada win out, with finish-times of 133, 145, and 148 minutes, respectively.\nAmong US states, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and New Mexico come out on top for the average finish-time of all runners with finish-times of 220 minutes for Colorado and 223 minutes for New Mexico. However, the fastest US runners hail from California, Colorado, and Massachusetts with finish-times of 141, 142, and 143 minutes, on average, for their top-10 finishers, respectively.\nNext, let’s take a look at performance in terms of the finish-times of runners. Men are faster than women on average. For example, in these year event the average finish-time for men was just over 224 minutes compared with 244 minutes for women. The graph below plots the proportion of runners with various finish-times. We can see a greater proportion of male finishers up to the 210 minute mark (3.5 hours), and after this it female runners tend to domainate.\n How does performance vary with age? This gender gap is preserved when we compare finish-times by age; see the Figure 12 below. For both men and women, the fastest runners tend to be in their 30’s, slightly older for women than for men. After this, as we age, our finish-times suffer. Interestingly, the relative difference between men and women reduces with age; the gender gap appears to close.\nThus, as we age, the finish-times of men and women tend to become more and more similar. In future analysis we’ll take a closer look at how each gender runs the course, regardless of time.\n  Conclusions That’s enough data for now — maybe too much? — or just enough as marathon season takes hold. The aim of this post was to provide a summary of the participants for the Boston Marathon, focusing on gender, age, place of origin, and comparing their participation numbers and finish-times.\nThat’s just the start of this analysis, however, and in the coming days I plan to look more deeply at the pacing of the Boston Marathon,\n  ","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"d04c725bf8d65ac48f64d95089c2e77a","permalink":"/post/boston_introduction/xxx_the_runniers_of_boston/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/boston_introduction/xxx_the_runniers_of_boston/","section":"post","summary":"SUMMARY ABOUT BOSTON","tags":["Academic","R Markdown","Visualization"],"title":"Running With The Data","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Boston Marathon","R","Running"],"content":" A Comparative Data Analysis of Eliud Kipchoge’s World Record at the 2018 Berlin Marathon A Brief Overview In the time since Eliud Kipchoge’s Breaking2 attempt on the Monza race-track in Italy, which secured him a place in the history books with 2 hours and 25 seconds over the marathon distance, he has seemed inevitable that he would go on to break the currentmarathon world-record, secured held by [Denis Kimetto] (https://www.iaaf.org/news/report/marathon-world-record-dennis-kimetto-berlin) since 2014 with a time of 2:02:57. And so, as Sunday morning approached the talk seemed less about if the current world-record would fall, and more about by how much.\nSince 1998 there have been 7 new male marathon world-records set on Berlin’s fast and flat course, 3 of them since 2010. Would we see a another? Sure enough, as if to order, Eliud Kipchoge served the latest world-record to Berlin crowds, crossing the line in an incredible 2:01:39, smashing the previous record by 1 minute and 18 seconds; we haven’t seen a record breaking margin of more than a minute since Derek Clayton lowered the world record from 2:12:00 to 2:09:37 in 1967; which is currently ranked in the world. It was all the more impressive because the 33-year-old Kenyan achieved it while running the last 17km on his own after the last of his pacers, not to mention the rest of the field, drifted away long before the finish.\n 2:01:39 in Comparison How does Kipchoge’s new record compare with previous WRs? The great thing about Berlin is that it attracts the best of the best and so not surprisingly quite a few WRs have been established there. This means we can perform a like-for-like comparison by comparing Kipchoge’s race to (in our dataset) the previous 5 fastest times in Berlin:\n#\u0026#39; AN INTERATIVE TO SHARE RESULTS MAYBE BASED IN SHINY ... top_times %\u0026gt;% arrange(rank) %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(marathon, \u0026quot;Berlin\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% head(5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 14 ## rank runner home marathon km_5 km_10 km_15 km_20 km_21.1 km_25 ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tim\u0026gt; ## 1 1 Eliud K… Kenya Berlin … 14\u0026#39;24\u0026quot; 29\u0026#39;01\u0026quot; 43\u0026#39;38\u0026quot; 57\u0026#39;56\u0026quot; 01:01 01:12 ## 2 2 Dennis … Kenya Berlin … 14\u0026#39;42\u0026quot; 29\u0026#39;24\u0026quot; 44\u0026#39;10\u0026quot; 58\u0026#39;36\u0026quot; 01:01 01:13 ## 3 3 Kenenis… Ethio… Berlin … 14\u0026#39;21\u0026quot; 29\u0026#39;00\u0026quot; 43\u0026#39;37\u0026quot; 58\u0026#39;02\u0026quot; 01:01 01:12 ## 4 5 Wilson … Kenya Berlin … 14\u0026#39;20\u0026quot; 29\u0026#39;00\u0026quot; 43\u0026#39;37\u0026quot; 58\u0026#39;02\u0026quot; 01:01 01:12 ## 5 6 Emmanue… Kenya Berlin … 14\u0026#39;42\u0026quot; 29\u0026#39;24\u0026quot; 44\u0026#39;09\u0026quot; 58\u0026#39;35\u0026quot; 01:01 01:13 ## # ... with 4 more variables: km_30 \u0026lt;time\u0026gt;, km_35 \u0026lt;time\u0026gt;, km_40 \u0026lt;time\u0026gt;, ## # km_42.2 \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; #\u0026#39; NUMBER OF SUB 2:10:00 MARATHONS THAT HAVE OCCURED IN BERLIN sub_210 %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(race, \u0026quot;Berlin\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% count() %\u0026gt;% mutate(`%` = n / nrow(sub_210)) ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## n `%` ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 141 0.0521 Figure 2 shows the pacing (in decimal mins/km) for all 4 WRs across each of the 5km segments of the race (5 km, 10 km, …, 40km), and the final 2.195km segment.

Kipchoge leads from the start, stays in front, and gradually but steadily extends his lead after the 15km mark. Kipsang stays in touch with Kipchoge during the first 15km of the race, getting to within just over 7 seconds by the end of the 15 km mark. But after this, begins to drop back. Meanwhile, Kimetto, after spending the first 20 km in 4th position (by 20 km he is 40 seconds behind Kipchoge), moves into second place and starts to recover some ground to get within 35 seconds of Kipchoge by the end of 35 km. Despite the beginnings of what might have been a late surge by Kimetto, Kipchoge is too strong and extends his now unassailable lead all the way to the end, finishing a full 78 seconds ahead of Kimetto, just over 94 seconds ahead of Kipsang, and almost 119 seconds ahead of Musyoki. To put this another way, we can estimate how far behind (in distance rather than time) each of Kimetto, Kipsang, and Musyoki would have been when Kipchoge crossed the line, based on their average race paces. The results of this are shown in Figure 7: Kimetto would have finished 446m (almost half a kilometer) behind Kipchoge; Kipsang would have been just under 600m behind; and Musyoki would have been 675m back.

He obliterated Kimetto’s 2014 record, set on the same course, and his incredibly disciplined negative split is all the more impressive because he did it largely on his own, after dropping the last of his pacers shortly after the halfway point.
