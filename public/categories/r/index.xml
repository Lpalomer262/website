      <description>Don’t listen to what they say. Go see. I’ve been stumbling my way around the world for seven years &amp;amp; counting. Via an interactive map, see all the places I’ve visited with just a few small stories to reminisce about.

      <title>Reflection - The Boston Marathon</title>

      <description>As of April 20th 2019, I’ve finished my sixth marathon. No matter how the preceding 26.2 miles have played out, I’ve always been thankful that my body has withstood the distance and my mind has managed its aversion to suffering. It also feels good to stop. Unlike each of the six marathons I’d run before, my feeling upon crossing the finish line in this year’s Boston Marathon was absolute joy.</description>

      <description>TLDR;  An analysis of more than 75,000 Boston Marathon race-records during the period 2014–2016;
 How do runners pace the Boston Marathon? Where are the fastest and slowest sections of the race?
 How does the pacing of elites compare to recreational runners and those running a personal-best?
 Putting what we learn into practice, we create optimal pacing charts for recreational runners that are tailored for Boston.</description>

      <description>TLDR  This is the second in a series of posts on a data analysis of Boston Marathon. The first post focused mainly on particpants and performance. In this post we will look at pacing. How do runners pace the Boston Marathon? Are there significant pacing differences associated with gender and age? Does ability or finish-time influence pacing? How does hitting the wall impact pacing? We will attempt to shed light on these questions using a dataset of more than 70,000 finishing-times for the Boston Marathon.</description>

      <description>A Data Analysis of the Boston Marathon TLDR  What happened at the Boston Marathon the past few years? In this article I present an initial analysis based on the data from this year’s event.
 For now we will focus on the participants of this year’s race — their gender, age, place of origin — comparing their participation numbers and finish-times.
   Introduction With the Boston Marathon quickly approching I thought I would write up a few posts on the data generated by the thousands of runners who completed the punishing course during the years: 2015, 2016, andw 2017.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the University of Colorado - Boulder&amp;rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence and Big Data course with Science Discovery
Ever wonder how the Netflix recommendation engine works or how Amazon.com determines what items “you may also like?” All these things are driven by training a computer how to learn using the large datasets. The data science course is a practical introduction to the interdisciplinary field of data science and machine learning which is at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and business.</description>
