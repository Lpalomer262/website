Ever wonder how the Netflix recommendation engine works or how Amazon.com determines what items “you may also like?” All these things are driven by training a computer how to learn using the large datasets. The data science course is a practical introduction to the interdisciplinary field of data science and machine learning which is at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and business. You will learn to use R to help you acquire, parse and model your data. A significant portion of the course will be a hands-on approach to the fundamental modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms that enable you to build robust predictive models of real-world data and test their validity.
