# Donâ€™t listen to what they say. Go see.

I've been stumbling my way around the world for seven years & counting. Via an interactive map, see all the places I've visited with just a few small stories to reminisce about. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

leaflet(data = travel) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lng = ~ lon,
    lat = ~ lat,
    popup = ~ detail, #' CREATE A FIELD WITH DESCRIPTIONS
    label = ~ place)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("continent", 
                "Countient:",
                c("North America",
                  "South America",
                  "Europe",
                  "Asia",
                  "Oceania",
                  "Africa"
                  )),
    leafletOutput("mymap")
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$mymap <- renderLeaflet({
      
      leaflet(data = travel %>%
                filter(continent %in% input$continent) #' FILTER FOR ONLY THE CONTINATE IN QUESTION
              ) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(
          lng = ~ lon,
          lat = ~ lat,
          popup = ~ detail, #' CREATE A FIELD WITH DESCRIPTIONS OR IMPORTANT EVENTS
          label = ~ place)
    })
    
  }
)
